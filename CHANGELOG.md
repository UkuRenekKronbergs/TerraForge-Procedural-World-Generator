## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added

#### Core Systems
- Initial release of TerraForge Procedural World Generator
- Unreal Engine 5.3 project structure with C++ support
- Complete module system with proper build configuration

#### Procedural Terrain Generation
- `NoiseGenerator` class with Perlin and Simplex noise algorithms
- Multi-octave fractal noise generation for detailed terrain
- `ProceduralTerrainActor` for real-time mesh generation
- Customizable terrain parameters:
  - Grid dimensions (width/height)
  - Noise scale and octaves
  - Height parameters
  - Persistence and lacunarity controls
- Seed-based reproducible world generation
- Smooth normal calculation for realistic lighting
- Proper UV mapping for material application
- Blueprint integration for all terrain functions

#### Water System
- `DynamicWaterActor` for procedural water planes
- Custom HLSL water shader (`WaterShader.usf`) featuring:
  - Animated waves using fractal Brownian motion (FBM)
  - Multi-layered wave patterns
  - Fresnel reflections for realistic water appearance
  - Depth-based color transitions
  - Normal mapping for surface detail
- Runtime-adjustable water parameters
- Material instance support for easy customization
- Subdivision control for performance/quality balance

#### Day/Night Cycle
- `DayNightCycleManager` for automated time progression
- Dynamic sun positioning based on time of day
- Smooth color transitions:
  - Day colors (bright sunlight)
  - Sunset/sunrise colors (warm tones)
  - Night colors (moonlight)
- Configurable intensity for different times
- Adjustable cycle speed
- Manual time control via Blueprint
- Sunrise and sunset time configuration

#### Camera System
- `FreeCameraPawn` for free-flight exploration
- Input system with multiple control modes:
  - WASD for horizontal movement
  - E/Q for vertical movement (ascend/descend)
  - Mouse look for camera orientation
  - Shift for sprint mode
  - Ctrl for slow movement mode
- Configurable parameters:
  - Base movement speed
  - Sprint and slow multipliers
  - Look sensitivity
  - Rotation smoothing
- Smooth camera interpolation for cinematic feel

#### Configuration
- Default input mappings for all camera controls
- Engine configuration with game mode setup
- Build system configuration for multiple platforms
- Editor and game build targets

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with:
  - Feature overview
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Controls reference
  - Customization guide
- API Reference with detailed class documentation
- Setup Guide for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Water Material Guide with shader integration
- Contributing guidelines
- MIT License

### Technical Details

#### Performance
- Async mesh cooking for terrain generation
- Efficient noise calculation with permutation table caching
- Material instance dynamics for runtime updates
- Optimized mesh generation algorithms

#### Architecture
- Modular C++ class design
- Blueprint-friendly with UFUNCTION/UPROPERTY exposure
- Proper UObject lifecycle management
- Memory-efficient with smart pointer usage where applicable

#### Compatibility
- Unreal Engine 5.3+ (compatible with 5.2)
- Windows, Mac, and Linux support
- DirectX 12 and Vulkan rendering support

### Known Limitations

- Terrain generation can be slow for very large grids (>200x200)
- Water shader requires custom material setup in editor
- No built-in terrain streaming or LOD system
- Day/night cycle requires manual linking to directional light for some setups

### Future Considerations

Potential features for future versions:
- Terrain LOD system for large worlds
- Biome system with different terrain types
- Vegetation placement system
- Weather effects (rain, fog, snow)
- Cave generation and overhangs
- Terrain painting and editing tools
- Multiplayer support with replication
- Terrain saving/loading system
- GPU-accelerated noise generation
- Advanced water features (foam, caustics, underwater effects)
